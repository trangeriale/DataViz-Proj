# DataViz-Proj
A data visualization project on PC builds and performance, coded partially for a UC Berkeley Extension UX/UI project, and partially to satisfy the inner nerd. I extracted data from https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/software to analyze CPU and GPU combinations for each PC and how it affects performance.

Please check out the ```firefox-version``` branch. The reason I chose Firefox for the browser was that when I ran this on my PC, the process was the smoothest and has fewest lags. 
The project is to be expanded to cover other PC parts and how each combination improves performance.

I used Selenium for data extraction and Seaborn for visualization.
